# File Context Hook
# Attaches file contents when the message contains @file:path/to/file
#
# Usage: Include @file:path/to/file anywhere in your message to attach
# the contents of that file to your prompt. Paths are relative to the
# working directory.
#
# Examples:
#   "Explain this code @file:main.go"
#   "What does this config do? @file:config/settings.yaml"
#   "Review these files @file:src/app.js @file:src/utils.js"
#
# Installation:
#   1. Copy this file and file-context.sh to your hooks directory
#   2. Make the script executable: chmod +x file-context.sh
#   3. Restart Mitto
