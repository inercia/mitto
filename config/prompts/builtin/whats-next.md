Analyze our progress and suggest next steps.

### Review:

1. **Completed**: What we've accomplished so far
2. **Current state**: Where the code/project stands now
3. **Remaining work**: What's left to do for the original goal

### Suggest next steps:

Present a prioritized list:

| Priority | Task | Reason | Effort |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | ... | ... | Small/Medium/Large |

### Consider:
- Dependencies (what must come before what)
- Risk (tackle risky items early)
- Value (high-impact items first)
- Blockers (anything preventing progress)

Ask if I want to proceed with the top priority item.
