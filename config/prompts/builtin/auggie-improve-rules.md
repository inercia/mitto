Review and update the Augment rules in `.augment/rules` based on all insights,
patterns, and lessons learned from our recent conversations and code changes.
Specifically:

1. Add any new architectural patterns or components that have been introduced
2. Document new conventions, best practices, or anti-patterns discovered during implementation
3. Update existing sections if they are outdated or incomplete
4. Add new sections for areas not currently covered (e.g., new packages, APIs, frontend patterns)
5. Ensure examples reflect the current codebase state

Focus on actionable guidance that will help future development sessions.
Do not remove existing valid content - only add or update information.
