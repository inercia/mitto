Add documentation to the code we just wrote.

### Add:

1. **Package/module docs**: Purpose, main types, usage examples
2. **Function/method docs**: What it does, parameters, return values, errors
3. **Complex logic comments**: Explain non-obvious algorithms or business rules
4. **TODO/FIXME**: Mark known limitations or future improvements
5. **Examples**: Usage examples for public APIs

### Guidelines:
- Explain WHY, not just WHAT (the code shows what)
- Keep comments close to the code they describe
- Update existing comments if code changed
- Use the documentation style standard for this language/project
- Don't state the obvious (avoid `// increment i` for `i++`)
