Analyze and fix the errors shown.

### For each error:

1. **Identify**: Quote the exact error message
2. **Diagnose**: Explain the root cause
   - What triggered this error?
   - Why did the code fail?
3. **Fix**: Implement the correction
   - Show the specific change made
   - Explain why this fixes the issue
4. **Verify**: Confirm the fix works
   - Run the code/tests again
   - Check for related issues

### If multiple errors:
- Fix in dependency order (fix causes before symptoms)
- Group related errors that share a root cause
- After fixing all, run a final verification
