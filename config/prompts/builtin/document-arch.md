Update the developer and architecture documentation to reflect the changes we just made.

### Find and update:

1. **New packages/modules**: Add to architecture docs, create dedicated doc if complex
2. **API changes**: Update relevant docs with new interfaces, methods, types
3. **Flow changes**: Update diagrams if the project uses them
4. **Design decisions**: Document rationale for non-obvious choices
5. **New patterns**: Add examples and guidelines

### Guidelines:

- Write for developers contributing to the codebase.
- Include code examples showing patterns to follow when relevant.
- Document design decisions and trade-offs.
- Follow the existing documentation style and structure.
- Cross-reference related documentation.
- Use mermaid diagrams when helpful.
