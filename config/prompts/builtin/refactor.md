Refactor the current code for better quality.

### Focus areas:

1. **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, types
2. **Structure**: Organize code logically, group related functionality
3. **Single responsibility**: Each function/class does one thing well
4. **DRY**: Extract repeated patterns into reusable components
5. **Error handling**: Consistent, informative error messages
6. **Idioms**: Follow language-specific best practices and conventions

### Process:
- Make one type of change at a time
- Run tests after each change to catch regressions
- Preserve external behavior (this is refactoring, not rewriting)

### Document:
- List each refactoring applied
- Explain the benefit of each change
