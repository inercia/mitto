Create a detailed plan for the current task.

### Structure your plan as:

1. **Goal**: What we're trying to achieve
2. **Current state**: What exists now, what's missing
3. **Steps**: Numbered list of concrete actions
   - Include file paths and function names where applicable
   - Estimate complexity (simple/medium/complex) for each step
   - Note dependencies between steps
4. **Risks**: Potential issues and how to mitigate them
5. **Verification**: How we'll know the task is complete

Present the plan and wait for approval before executing.
