Explain the code or concept we just discussed.

### Structure your explanation:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this solve? Why does it exist?
2. **How it works**: Step-by-step walkthrough of the logic
3. **Key components**: Important functions, classes, or patterns used
4. **Data flow**: How data moves through the system
5. **Edge cases**: Special conditions or error handling
6. **Dependencies**: What this relies on, what relies on it

Use concrete examples from the code. Avoid jargon unless you define it.
