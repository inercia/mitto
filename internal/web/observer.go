// SessionObserver defines the interface for receiving session events.
// This allows multiple clients (WebSocket connections) to observe a single session.
//
// Events that are persisted include a sequence number (seq) for ordering and deduplication.
// The seq is assigned when the event is received from the ACP, ensuring streaming and
// persisted events have the same seq. Clients can use seq to:
// - Deduplicate events (same session_id + seq = same event)
// - Order events correctly after reconnection
// - Track which events they've seen for sync requests
