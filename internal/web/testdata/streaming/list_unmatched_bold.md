# List with Unmatched Bold Across Lines

This fixture tests a list where bold formatting spans across a blank line.
The bold starts in item 4 but closes in the following paragraph.

1. **First item** - Description
2. **Second item** - Description
3. **Third item** - Description
4. **Real-time

messaging works after refresh** - New messages sent after refresh were properly received and displayed

The fix to the observer registration timing appears to be working.
